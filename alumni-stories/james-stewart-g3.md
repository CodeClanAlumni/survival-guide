## Background

Worked five years in politics - 3 for a Cabinet Minister in Westminster and 2.5 as a lobbyist for a charity. Only had experience in HTML/CSS coming into the course.

### First job

My first position was for a very small start-up where I somehow landed the position as sole backend developer working with Node and Neo4j (wtf?). It was a really difficult post to hold for a first job, a baptism of fire. I had to really quickly learn how to do things without any support or input. There was no CTO. I relied on the CodeClan Alumni network and CodeYourFuture mentors to help me out (special mention to Scott Riley).

I started looking for new jobs about a month into the role and left after 3 months because I got another job:

### Current job

I currently work for a start-up/scale-up as a Software Developer in a team of 5. The codebase is PHP and Vue.js - I had experience with Vue which was what attracted me to the post in the first place but no PHP experience.

It's been night and day to my first job. I'm grateful that I had the experience of the first job as it helped me land this one, but I would really consider if taking a sole anything role is best for you when you are fresh out of CodeClan.

It's a great place to work. Classic startup material: free food and beer and work holidays.

### Other stuff

I did a contract for the World Bank and the Prince's Trust in the evenings during my first job, both in VueJS/Node.
