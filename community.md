# Community

Both while you're looking for your first job after CodeClan and once you've started it, getting involved in the developer community can be a great way to meet new people, learn new things and further your career. 

Some of us find it draining to go to lots of social events and speak to lots of new people, but there are many ways to stay involved - Chloe Condon's post [The Ambivert's Guide to Staying in Tech](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/the-ambivert-s-guide-to-staying-in-tech) has tips for extroverts, introverts, and those in between. 

## Slack channels

The most important Slack channel to join is the unofficial CodeClan Alumni chat. We try to add graduating students automatically, but if you have finished the course and haven't received an invite speak to one of your instructors. 

Other community Slack channels include:

* We All JS - https://wealljs.org/
* Code Newbie - http://bit.ly/CodeNewbieSlack
* Codebar - https://slack.codebar.io/
* Elm - https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/

## Meetups and events

* The [Open Tech Calendar](https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/) has listings for events in Edinburgh, Glasgow and beyond
* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) is a good place to search
* [Diversity Tickets](https://diversitytickets.org/) lists events with free or discounted tickets for underrepresented folk to apply for - often conferences have discounted student rates as well
* [Codebar](http://www.codebar.io/) runs programming workshops in Glasgow and Edinburgh - you could attend as either a student or a coach
* [CodeYourFuture](https://codeyourfuture.io/) run programming courses for refugees, and are always looking for volunteers

### Glasgow
