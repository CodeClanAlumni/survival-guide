# Getting a job

## Your Portfolio Site

While you are job hunting and unemployed, maintaining a portfolio site which shows off your work can be a great way of keeping on top of continued coding practice and is an excellent way to show off what you can do to prospective employers.

* [SkillCrush have a great guide on stuff you can put in there](https://skillcrush.com/2016/09/12/beginner-portfolio-guide/)
* [FreeCodeCamp has some good examples here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae)

## Your GitHub Profile

It's worth sprucing up your GitHub page and pinning the repos you're most keen for employers to see. Every important repo should have a good readme.

## Your CV

Your CV should be slightly tailored for each job you apply for. The best way of doing that is picking out key words from the job description and highlighting or repeating them back in your CV. For example, if it's a front end job based on JavaScript, make sure to emphasise the JS project you did at CodeClan and any other JS work you've done.
