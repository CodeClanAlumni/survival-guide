      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Worked five years in politics - 3 for a Cabinet Minister in Westminster and 2.5 as a lobbyist for a charity. Only had experience in HTML/CSS coming into the course.</p>

<h2 id="since-codeclan">Since CodeClan</h2>
<p>Written: Sept 2018</p>

<h3 id="first-job">First job</h3>

<p>My first position was for a very small start-up where I somehow landed the position as sole backend developer working with Node and Neo4j (wtf?). It was a really difficult post to hold for a first job, a baptism of fire. I had to really quickly learn how to do things without any support or input. There was no CTO. I relied on the CodeClan Alumni network and CodeYourFuture mentors to help me out (special mention to Scott Riley).</p>

<p>I started looking for new jobs about a month into the role and left after 3 months because I got another job:</p>

<h3 id="current-job">Current job</h3>

<p>I currently work for a start-up/scale-up as a Software Developer in a team of 5. The codebase is PHP and Vue.js - I had experience with Vue which was what attracted me to the post in the first place but no PHP experience.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been night and day to my first job. Iâ€™m grateful that I had the experience of the first job as it helped me land this one, but I would really consider if taking a sole anything role is best for you when you are fresh out of CodeClan.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a great place to work. Classic startup material: free food and beer and work holidays.</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h3>

<p>I did a contract for the World Bank and the Princeâ€™s Trust in the evenings during my first job, both in VueJS/Node.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve found that Iâ€™ve coded outside work a lot less since I started coding for a job. Itâ€™s important to know thatâ€™s totally normal. If youâ€™re coding 8-10 hours at work, not coding at home isnâ€™t going to damage your skills.</p>
