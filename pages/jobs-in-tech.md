## Jobs in Tech
Below are some descriptions of the various types of roles that you might see when looking for a job. These descriptions are based on the experiences of alumni who have had them, and focus on what sorts of things you might expect from a junior level position. As with any industry, titles can have quite a fluid meaning and each company will attribute a slightly different set of responsibilities each title.
