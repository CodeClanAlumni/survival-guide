## Background

Degree in Archaeology from Edinburgh, only work experience was in the hospitality industry and knew very little about coding except for a Python book I had picked up a year before CodeClan.

### First & Current job

I've been working at FanDuel since May 2017, getting the job a couple months after graduating.  I didn't know of any junior positions when I originally applied, applying just for 'Software Engineer'.  With my first phone interview, was lucky enough to discover they were doing a graduate engineer program for most of the areas of the engineering teams, API, iOS, Android and Frontend.  I was eager for the frontend as that is what I had been studying vigorously for, having seen it as the best way to get my first developer job. 'Graduated' a few months early than what was planned for me to a mid-level engineer.

In my role today I work on more than just frontend because I made it known that I wanted to be a full-stack engineer.  Every day working on different services, using Python, Java and Javascript I am constantly learning and it is still exhausting today as it was when I started.

FanDuel is an ever changing company based in America so there is definitely an interesting dynamic, but our wellbeing is important to the company and we all work hard because of it.  The people really make the place.

### Other stuff

Motivation fluctuates so much for me but I continue to engage with the community helping out with CodeBar in Glasgow and attending meetups like Ladies of Code.  Have done a couple of lightning talks outside of work and I wish to do more!  
I'm not one to do much coding outside work in place of other hobbies and life goals, and that's okay :)
